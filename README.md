## Objective
I have a lifelong passion for technology and a strong desire to help people, which led me to the field of cybersecurity. With 13 years of experience as a Nuclear Operator and Supervisor, I bring a unique set of skills highly relevant to cybersecurity roles, including expertise in high-stakes incident response, operational technology (OT) security, and working with complex systems under pressure. My experience in critical infrastructure environments allows me to bring an adaptable and detail-oriented approach to tackling cybersecurity challenges. 

I am eager to transition into cybersecurity, initially focusing on roles such as SOC Analyst, with a long-term goal of progressing into Red or Purple Team roles, Penetration Testing, and ultimately becoming a Security Architect.
