## Objective
I have a lifelong passion for technology and a strong desire to help people, which led me to the field of cybersecurity. With 13 years of experience as a Nuclear Operator and Supervisor, I bring exceptional skills that are highly relevant to cybersecurity roles. I excel in quickly learning complex topics, adapting to high-stress environments, and communicating effectively as both a team player and supervisor.

I am eager to transition into cybersecurity, aiming to start in a Security Operations Center and progress to a Red or Purple Team role, followed by becoming a Penetration Tester and ultimately a Security Architect.
